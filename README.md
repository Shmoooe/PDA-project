# Abalone Dataset

This repository contains my data analysis of the ![Abalone Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone). I used the dataset to create an overview of the variables present and to create visuals such as a bar chart, histograms and scatter plots. These allowed me to gain insights from the data set and observe the relationship between variables. Particularly between height and weight.

## Repository
This repository contains four files:

1. ### .gitignore

    This file will ignore specific files from being tracked in the git repository.

2. ### README.md

    This README file is to give a glimpse into the focus of this repository and its contents.

3. ### abalone.csv

    This file contains our dataset and is compatible with Python libraries such as "Pandas", which allows us to open, read and manipulate the data.

4. ### abalone.ipynb

    This is the Jupyter Notebook where you will find the code and the analysis of the data itself.
